# Enhanced Security Features Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive security features implemented in this React application to mitigate risks from the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, with a special focus on XSS and CSRF protections.

## XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Protections

### Defense-in-Depth Approach

#### 1. Trusted Types Implementation
- Created a Trusted Types policy (`dompurify`) for DOM sanitization
- Implemented context-specific sanitizers for HTML, URLs, script content, and CSS
- Used the `createSanitizedContent` helper for secure DOM sanitization

#### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implemented a nonce-based CSP for stronger protection
- Granular CSP directives for different resource types
- Configurable CSP through the `securityHeaders` module

#### 3. XSS Detection & Monitoring
- Client-side XSS auditor for detecting DOM manipulation attempts
- Runtime monitoring of DOM mutations
- Automated detection and logging of potential XSS payloads
- Patches critical DOM methods (`innerHTML`, `document.write`) for monitoring

#### 4. Input Sanitization
- Context-specific sanitization for different output contexts
- Enhanced DOMPurify integration with Trusted Types
- Custom React hooks for automatic XSS detection in user inputs (`useXSSDetection`)

#### 5. React-Specific XSS Protections
- Custom ESLint rule (`no-unsafe-dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) to detect unsafe usage
- Enhanced security for `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage
- Safer component patterns for displaying user content

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protections

### Enhanced CSRF Protection

#### 1. Token Mechanisms
- CSRF token rotation for added security
- Token history tracking for handling in-flight requests
- Granular token validation mechanisms
- Cryptographically strong token generation

#### 2. Multi-Layer Validation
- Header, cookie, and request body validation
- Origin validation with allowlists
- Integration with security monitoring for anomaly detection

#### 3. Framework Integration
- Automatic CSRF token inclusion via Axios interceptors
- React hooks for CSRF protection (`useCSRFToken`, `useCSRFProtectedForm`)
- Seamless integration with form submissions

#### 4. CSRF Monitoring & Logging
- Detailed logging of CSRF validation failures
- Integration with security monitoring subsystem
- Rate limiting for suspicious requests

## Security Headers Implementation

Comprehensive security headers setup including:

1. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**
   - Granular control of resource loading
   - Nonce-based script execution control

2. **Permissions-Policy**
   - Control browser feature access (camera, microphone, etc.)

3. **X-XSS-Protection**
   - Enabled in block mode for extra protection

4. **X-Frame-Options**
   - Protection against clickjacking

5. **Strict-Transport-Security**
   - Enforces HTTPS connections with long max-age

6. **Referrer-Policy**
   - Controls information in the Referer header

7. **Cross-Origin Resource Policies**
   - Protects against cross-origin information leakage

## Security Monitoring & Telemetry

1. **Security Event Logging**
   - Centralized security event logging
   - Severity classification
   - Configurable reporting endpoints

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Threshold-based detection of suspicious activity
   - Automated alerts for security events

3. **React Integration**
   - Security hooks for component usage
   - Easy logging of security events

## Implementing Risk-Based Security

1. **Enhanced Authentication**
   - Improved password validation and complexity requirements
   - Protection against password reuse

2. **Security Feedback**
   - User feedback for security-related events
   - Clear security warnings and guidance

## Usage Examples

### Sanitizing User Input

```jsx
import { createSanitizedContent } from '../security';

// In your component
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createSanitizedContent(userContent)} />
```

### Using CSRF Protection in Forms

```jsx
import { useCSRFToken } from '../security';

// In your component
const { getCSRFToken } = useCSRFToken();

<form>
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value={getCSRFToken()} />
  {/* Rest of your form */}
</form>
```

### Detecting XSS in User Inputs

```jsx
import { useXSSDetection } from '../security';

// In your component
const { checkValue } = useXSSDetection();

const handleChange = (event) => {
  const input = event.target.value;
  if (checkValue(input)) {
    // Handle potential XSS attempt
    setWarning('Potentially unsafe content detected');
  } else {
    setUserInput(input);
  }
};
```

## Security Architecture

The security features are organized in a modular structure:

- `security/trustedTypes.ts` - Trusted Types implementation
- `security/xssAuditor.ts` - XSS detection and prevention
- `security/csrfProtection.ts` - Enhanced CSRF protection
- `security/securityHeaders.ts` - Security headers configuration
- `security/securityMonitoring.ts` - Security event logging
- `security/index.ts` - Main initialization and integration
